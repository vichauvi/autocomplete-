# autocomplete-
Project completed in ESC190: Data Structures and Algorithms. The autocomplete code is a quick implementation of parsing through related search terms for the top search term matching a query string. Thanks to Michael Guerzhoy for the instructional file. 

This project was completed in the winter term of first year UofT Engineering Science, and is written in C. The program is able to take in a list of formatted terms, sort them in lexicographic order, and then reach both the lowest and highest match term by weighting.
